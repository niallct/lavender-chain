# CWCC Indoor

## General
* Striker's and bowler's ends are fixed throughout
* After three balls of not changing ends (eg three dots, three fours), batters change ends
* Hitting the roof is out. ('Hit Roof', bowler gets credit)
* The balcony is, for purpose of Hit Roof, part of the roof
* LBW is not used
* All other modes of dismissal apply
* No runs can be scored from a hit behind square
* Byes and leg-byes can be run if the ball goes behind square [?] _yes seems fair, tho note the difficulty of umpiring this (i.e. was there bat involved or not?) -- we can see how it goes_
* Actual runs made score double
* Score one for hitting the side wall. 
  * The ball is not dead, so a catch is possible, and if caught score no runs
  * Do not change ends because of scoring one
  * Overthrows hitting the side wall still score one
* The end wall is a boundary.
  * Six for hitting on the full, four if bounced.
  * As with outdoor, contact with a fielder in contact with the boundary means a boundary is scored
  * The ball is dead when it touches the wall
* Wides and no-balls score two runs and are not rebowled
* A short pitched ball is a no-ball regardless of where it passed the striker
* Choose number of balls in over and overs to play to fit nicely with player number and time available

## Pairs format
* Batting pair get all runs scored, including extras
* Batting pair lose five for every wicket lost  _shall we try 4?_
* Bowling pair get five for every wicket taken (not run outs)  _ditto? +4_
* Catches, stumping, run out get two to the pair effecting it. (For run out this is the person who threw in)
  * alternative - five for outfield ct/ro, two for w-k dismissal
* The person of the pair bowling  who isn't bowling keeps wicket
* Try for two overs per batting pair (maybe five-ball sets?)
* _Pairs selection: randomly count people as 1s or 2s_

## Teams format [NB: i can also see a pairs-within-teams format]
* A broadly conventional two side format
* Probably six or seven a side is best
* If enough people have a resting side who umpire/score
* Conventional scoring and determining of result
* Share bowling round as evenly as possible
* Batters swap ends at the end of an over
* Wides and no-balls in the last over are rebowled
* Decide what to retire on based on number of players and time available
  * Suggest 20
  * Retired batters can come back  
* Players waiting to bat sit on benches behind the keeper
* If the ball hits waiting players or their bags, it is dead

## To try Sept 2024
- [ ] what do we do with the net on the end wall?  _try drawing it across; see if this seems safer for fielders_
- [ ] put the striker's end wicket closer to the wall than we had it, and take a photo
- [ ] tape on the floor as creases, wide lines, and short ball line
- [ ] use a different coloured ball (orange or yellow were suggested)
- [ ] what do we do about three sixes - out? just swap ends?  _i think just swap ends for now, but we could make it 3 and out next time_
- [ ] is there a too-high on the end wall line? top of the net?  _i think not to do this_
- [ ] change ends when striker out? non-striker out?  _yes_
- [ ] wicket-keeper -- allow subs, I think; any element of auto-wickie?  _i like the other-person-in-bowling-pair thing mentioned above_

## Other variations we thought of
* schedule so that the same bowling pair bowl both a batting pair's sets, or different; if the former can seed a bit
* a tape mark on the floor
* bowling off 1 or 2 paces only (maybe), or at least a mark on floor
* possibly -5 is too harsh for a wicket?
* back wall - behind the striker - score for hitting, but as byes?

## List of materials
* stumps, bails, bats
* balls -- several types, try a few out
* tape for marking the floor
* measuring tape
* scoresheets and pens
